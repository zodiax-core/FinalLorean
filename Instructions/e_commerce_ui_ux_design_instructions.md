# UI/UX Design Instructions

## 1. Design Vision

The website should feel **calm, premium, and modern**, similar to Shopify’s official website. The goal is a **soft, comfy UI** with **subtle but delightful animations**, not flashy or heavy. The design must communicate trust, simplicity, and smoothness.

Overall vibe:
- Soft
- Clean
- Slightly futuristic
- Liquid / glass-like
- Smooth motion

---

## 2. Visual Style

### 2.1 Color Palette

- Base colors: Off-white, light gray, soft beige
- Accent colors: Pastel blue, soft purple, mint
- Text: Dark gray (not pure black)
- Avoid harsh contrasts

Use gradients sparingly and softly (very low saturation).

---

## 3. Typography

- Primary font: Modern sans-serif (Inter, SF Pro, or similar)
- Font weights:
  - Light / Regular for body text
  - Medium / Semi-bold for headings

Spacing should feel airy. No cramped layouts.

---

## 4. Layout Principles

- Large white space
- Grid-based layout
- Rounded corners everywhere (cards, buttons, modals)
- Content should “breathe”

Use cards for:

## 5. Glass / Liquid Design Elements

### 5.1 Crystal Liquid Glass Effect

Use **glassmorphism-inspired elements** with:
- Semi-transparent backgrounds
- Subtle blur (backdrop-filter)
- Light border strokes
- Soft inner glow

Possible usage:
- Navbar (primary use)

---

## 6. Navbar Design

- Floating navbar
- Glass / liquid effect

- Rounded pill-style container
- Smooth hide/show on scroll

Navbar animation:
- Slight blur increase on scroll

## 7. Animations & Motion

### 7.1 Motion Philosophy

Animations should feel:
- Natural
- Slow-in, slow-out
- Purposeful

No fast or bouncy animations.

---

### 7.2 Parallax Effects

- Subtle parallax on hero sections
- Background images move slower than foreground

---

### 7.3 Micro-interactions

---

## 10. Accessibility
